    # Al-Gaia  
    
    I'd be lying if I didn't have parts of me that love the Al-gaians, especially those from Lyonesse. The Estragalians 
    can be a bit hoity toity for my tastes but they're still good people. They hate deamons, they are almost as violent 
    towards the undead as we are.    
     
    
    The only thing I can really hold against them is the fact that they believe their Goddess and Hunter are the be all 
    and end all of gods, which just shows how you can be friends with someone even if they're really stupid.
