    # Taniaste

    ![Bryn's Portrait](img/bryn.svg)

    The single most, attractive, intelligent, and above all modest person you will ever meet. I am the Taniaste,
    I carry the memories of countless lifetimes, I use these memories to advise both the Ymherawdwr and Winter Prince,
    but more importantly I act as an advisor to anyone who asks for it.


    I remember the people from the time before we were the Fir Cruthen, before you even knew who you were, I will
    stay with you for as long as you need me to. I have no doubt that there will come a day when you no-longer have need
    of me and I will finally be able to rest.

    It had been a cold winter, when the Stranger found us, he did not say why he was looking for us, but only that he 
    had been looking for us, That was all we called him, to begin with, there was ‘us", the Tribe, and there were those 
    rare other people we would encounter, who were ‘them".  
    
    We didn't know all the things the Stranger told us, back then, we just knew what we needed to know, which berries
    were good to eat, how to skin animals, to cook meat, to make weapons. There was not much need for anything else, and
    soon, we did not worry about such things, the Stranger took care of it all, advising the Elders.  
    
    We had Gods of course, the Mother, and the Father. Some thought that the Stranger was the Father, made flesh, some 
    said he was the Father's Son, but would that not make him like ourselves?  
    
    Certainly he did occasionally cut himself, and bleed, just as anyone else did, sometimes he grew ill, during the 
    time of the bad meat we were afeared he would die, and leave us, but even though the meat was bad that year, we 
    would have still taken his essence into ourselves, to make the Stranger "us" and not "them".
    
    
    It would have been in the time of my mother's mother's mother's mother when we noticed the difference, for all he 
    looked the same as "us" the Stranger was not one of "us". We grew old, wizened and died, some forty summers or so, 
    but not he. We asked for his name and he simply said "Taniaste".
    
    
    We knew, from his wisdom, and magic, and cunning ways, that he was something different from "us" and from "them", 
    because there was one defining feature about him, one that lasted for more than nine lifetimes, in nine lifetimes 
    he aged, but one thing never happened to Taniaste.
    
    
    He Never Died.
    
    
    He had a name, a real name, he confided, as a sickness took him, and lamentation was upon the people, and he said 
    that even he could die, but that his spirit, his soul, would live on, and watch over our tribe, forever, and that 
    whenever mortal flesh grew too weak a cage to hold such bold spirit within it, that even though he could not die of 
    old age, disease and disaster could end him, that it would escape such humble bondage and seek a new host, man, 
    woman, one of the Knockers, Sluagh, Clurichauns or Wyld Folk, something that was to be feared, mistrusted, but we 
    should not mistrust any who came to us with that name "Taniaste"
    
    
    I say he never died, in this I  both lie and tell truth. I know the name of the one who called himself "Taniaste", 
    in a time when the Aurochs and Mammoths were aplenty, in a time when the world looked different, more ice, bitter 
    cold, and we, ourselves changed, now, people live to five tens of years, rather than dying before they hit four 
    tens, now, we see more people, there is not just "us" and "them".
    
    
    I remember this, because the Stranger, the Taniaste, told me his name. His name was "Yrial"
    
    
    That was his given name, at birth, though who his mother and father were, I never did learn, and even now, with what 
    I know, I cannot remember, and I know much, because to you all now, I tell this story, we have come so far, and our 
    tribe covers so much land, and when we must make war, we do so in ferocity and clad in the sky! The Gods and 
    Goddesses must surely favour us, for we spread and survive, we people, we people of the thousand enemies, we people 
    of the designs ... We Cruithne.
    
    
    It has been some ten generations since the death of Yrial, the Stranger, the Taniaste, but he spoke truth. They
    will always be with us, always. How do I know this? Because I am Fingol, and hold his memories in my head. I am 
    Fingol, Yrial spoke truth, because his memories are in me, I remember ice and bones and a time when there was 
    nothing even human about us, but ... "things" ... "weapons", and I remember the horrible laughter of those times and
    I will protect us from them, we people, we people of the painted designs, we Fir, For I am Taniaste, I am Fingol, 
    the second Taniaste, and we Fir, the Fir Cruithne, will always be under our protection!
