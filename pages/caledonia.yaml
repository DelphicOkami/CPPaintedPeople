    # Caledonia
    
    I mean, it's Caledonia, what more can I say about it. A rough, wild place comprised of the sprawling archipelagos 
    and island chains to the north of Albion.    
    
    Its people are renowned for being gruff, straightforwards, and eager for a fight. Their major exports are cattle,
    steel, warriors, trouble, and jokes about "yer ma".
    
    
    Truth be told there are few peoples I would rather have at my back in a battle than the Caledonians, whether it's 
    the terrifyingly powerful Tiogoradh, or the quiet, unassuming Bree. I would rather have them on my side than fight
    against them any day.

    Often aye, a nation snoozing as it were, but for all that, ones you would want at your side.  
    Look you, They’ve had rough times, but weathered them, it is fair to say that Caledonia provides steel, in both the
    metal, and the mettle of its warriors

    To go to war without Caledonians at your back, is like to go to war forgetting your sword, what do you do, you pick
    up your sword you wee prick, same in war, you go and get the pricks of the North up and aroused

    They’re rough folks, keener than a razor edge when it comes to a bargain, and keener still in a fight. 
    They’re rascals, but aren't we all now?
