    # Ymherawdwr


    The Ymherawdwr (AKA "High King Cole", "Jimmy Two Knives", and "That bloke just tried to kill me"). He leads the Fir
    Cruthen with true grit and determination. He is absolutely terrifying on the battlefield cutting down enemies by the
    dozen without so much as a hint of fear.


    If I didn't say nice things about him he would probably throw me onto the fires of Beltaine, but he is actually a
    good man, just don't let him hear you say that.
