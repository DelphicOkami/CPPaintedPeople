    Cymria, a land of true beauty, more so than any of the other Fir Cruthen lands. No where more so than Witch
    Mountain, if you ever get the chance to visit, take a Tan with you and you'll


  Cymrja is a vast landmass that adjoins Albion to its West, the land technically is two, incorporating the
  large island of Gwynfydd, or ‘Purity’ which is the seat of the Druidic Council. Cymrja is a dichotomy, its people tend
  to eschew the Kilts favoured in other lands, and tend towards heavier armour. Almost uniquely, they have Knightly
  Orders, similar to those across the border in Albion, however they operate very differently.
  Cymrjans also favour Black, as the colour of their Woad, not Blue, like the other nations, this is a tradition sadly
  lost to time, none knows its origin. They even speak a separate manner of Gaelic there, known as Cymric. Cymrja is
  also home to the Braeg Wild Elves of the Black Forest of Dyfedd, and the Trollish folk who inhabit the Swamplands
  there. The Ruler of Cymrja is always referred to as ‘The Dragon’. Currently the Dragon is Kayle MacAther, who also is
  the Warlord of all Fir Cruthen. As such, wars have kept him from his home for so long, it is uncertain where his
  ancestral seat will be, however proceeding Dragon’s have favoured the towns of Machynlleth or Harlech.
    Gwynfydd Island , in darker times known as Cym Dubh, The Black Heart, is almost solely inhabited by Druids, and
  those sworn to them, The Council of Druids of all four nations meet here, in seclusion, with the Taniaste, and
  disperse, to guide the people. Cymrja’s warfleet is not large, but access to Gwynfydd would be difficult indeed, for
  any without business there.

    I went to Cymria three years back, it was raining, when I got there, they said it was shut.
    They’ve a funny way about them, you can never tell, but I say this, scratch a cymrian, and they bleed wisdom.
    This is Truth.

    Its an awkward balance, at times, they seem like Albion, but then, you see their Knights coming back with
    enemy heads on their belts, blood on their faces, aye, they’re alright

    The earth rattles as they do, its hard to believe they are of the same folk as us, but it’s the same Gods,
    the same cries in battle, the same blood on swords, and *this* is where our wisdom comes from? ... you wait a moment
    longer, see the eyes of their warriors, the exhortations of their druids, and you think, Yes!
    This ***is*** where our wisdom comes from
