    # Cymrja


    Cymrja, a land of wisdom and true beauty, more so than any of the other Fir Cruthen lands, and within Cymrja nowhere holds more
    of this beauty than Witch Mountain, if you ever get the chance to visit, take a Tan with you and you'll understand
    what true beauty looks like ... but you stay away from my ma you hear!!
    
    
    To the east of Cymrja you will find the nation of Albion, these close neighbours have had a major influence on our
    Cymrjan brethren over the years, for in this nation you will find the Fir Cruthen's only Knightly Orders, these
    stand in stark contrast to the seat of the Druidic Council.

    Their woad is black rather than the blue favoured by the other nations, it is the home of the Braeg Wild Elves of
    the Black Forest of Dyfedd, and trollish folk who inhabit the swamplands. Their leader is always referred to as The
    Dragon.


    Cymrja has a second landmass, Gwynfydd Island, in darker times known as Cym Dubh, the Black Heart, it is entirely
    inhabited by Druids and those sworn to them. The Council of Druids of all four nations meet here, in seclusion, with
    me and from there we disperse, to spread guidance amongst the people.

    Woe betide any, even the largest fleet of ships, that seek access to Gwynfydd island, they would find the going
    treacherous unless they have business with those who reside there.

    I went to Cymrja three years back, it was raining, when I got there, they said it was shut.
    They’ve a funny way about them, you can never tell, but I say this, scratch a Cymrjan, and they bleed wisdom.
    This is Truth.

    Its an awkward balance, at times, they seem like Albion, but then, you see their Knights coming back with
    enemy heads on their belts, blood on their faces, aye, they’re alright

    The earth rattles as they do, its hard to believe they are of the same folk as us, but it’s the same Gods,
    the same cries in battle, the same blood on swords, and *this* is where our wisdom comes from? ... you wait a moment
    longer, see the eyes of their warriors, the exhortations of their druids, and you think, Yes!
    This ***is*** where our wisdom comes from
