     Druids are our conduit to the Gods, they act as the bridge between us and them. It is a difficult task, there is a 
     saying amongst our people "some Gods you worship, some you appease", it is a druid's job to know which is which and
     who is at war with whom amongst the pantheon.   
     
     They have the additional burden of counselling any Fir Cruthen on spiritual matters, whether that Fir Cruthen is 
     under a curse of geas that they do not understand, or whether they seek to follow a different path in life to the
     one they are currently on.
     
     
     Druids work closely with bards, where a bard will tell you the history of a thing, a druid can tell of of the 
     unseen currents moving around and directing events, and from these tell you *why* a thing happened.
     
     
     Druids have a vested interest in the Grove, the spiritual heart of the war host, a place of contemplation, rites,
     and meetings. A potent place and a druid can milk from it a portion of the power therein contained to better 
     prepare the war host for whatever they are facing.
     
     
     Druids are also responsible for the turn of the year, ensuring the rites of the four major festivals are observed 
     correctly. Whether that be the hearth fires and stories of Imbolic, the mighty fires and weddings of Beltaine, the 
     stories, gifts and celebrations of Lughnasadh or the quite contemplations and reverences of Samhain.
