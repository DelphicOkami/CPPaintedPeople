    # Erin
    
    A gleaming golden jewel of a land, much beloved in legend and song.
    
    
    The home of the bardic tradition, in many ways still recovering from multiple waves of invasion, still trying to
    reclaim the voices which were once held so high in song and story.

    The Erinians hae had a rougher roll of the dice than most, fate has been unkind to them, wave after wave of 
    invasions, yet for all that, they come up smiling, really, they’re an inspiration, a metaphor for our people, they’re
    often tested, yet never bested, gods speed to those glorious bastards.

    For the Fir Cruthen folk of Erin, are the men that Gods made mad, for all their wars are happy, and all their songs 
    are sad

    So much as touch an Erinian, and you’ve set off a blood feud that will last a hundred years, those people never-ever
    forget
