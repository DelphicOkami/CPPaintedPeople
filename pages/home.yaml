    # Welcome

    So people keep asking me questions, a lot of these are the same question so I thought I'd do the smart thing and
    write some of those   answers down so that you people can get the answers for yourself and stop bugging me.


    I've tried to break all of this down into sensible sections so you don't have to read all of my ramblings.


    If any of you feel like you have useful information please feel free to write it down and I'll add it for you,
    or you can just bung your own comments on the pages if you know how

    Note: Bryn's handwriting is terrible so if you click the pen at the top of the page it should become more readable,
    I also don't like how it looks so if you click on the sun it will become gentler on your eyes.
