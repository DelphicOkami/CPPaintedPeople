    # Jhereg  
    
    So the Jhereg, what can I say? If you want to find a powerful magic item, they've probably got it, however they 
    probably got it through means I wildly disagree with. They deal with undead and have no issue with deamons as long 
    as they come out on top.


    I find them to be a difficult people to trust, their interactions with the undead alone is enough to raise my
    hackles, so I personally do not trust them, that being dead if you need a powerful enemy killed they probably have
    the tools to do it.
