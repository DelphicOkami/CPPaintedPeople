    # Winter Prince

    ![Kayle Portrait](img/kayle.svg)
    Kayle, the Winter Prince, embraced winter to bring balance to our people. Unlike Cole if I didn't say anything nice
    he would not throw me on the fire, as that would be far less effort than just stabbing me in the face.  
    
    Finding something less than good to say about Kayle is difficult, he has sacrificed a lot for the good of our 
    people, sacrifices he has to live with on a daily basis, he may seem dour, cold, and emotionally distant but he must
    feel something deeply for us or he wouldn't have given so much of himself.


    Kayle leads our armies on the battlefield, as he has mastered the tactical arts, specifically the art of tactically
    getting to the bar after everyone else has a drink already.
