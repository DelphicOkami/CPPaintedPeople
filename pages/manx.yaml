    Let's look at this map, you see those 3 green blobs over to the left, those are Bronagh, Mann, and Keirlug they are 
    Manx, yes all of them.  
    
    You see, Manx is a mongrel nation settled from the other three nations because of this they carry a part of the 
    other nations within them. The people of Manx excel at near enough everything they set their minds to, hell they 
    have the second most complete library in all of our lands, that is kept in Kierluig.  
    
    
    Really the only thing stopping Manx from dominating the world is the fact that everyone and their third cousin seems
    to invade every other week, I think they're all just looking for Manxvegas but we will see when we actually take 
    back control of the islands.

    Most of them are Caledonian émigré's only a generation ago, so of *course* they're natural born scrappers, seriously
    though, they're a canny folk

    Like a good stew, you throw bits in, and blend it together, and what comes out is tastier than carrots alone, or 
    potatoes, or even beef, well, maybe not beef, but the metaphor stands look you, don't make me fetch my beating
    ladle, got a sting it does, but Manx folk, aye, they're a rare old mix they are, and sure I am we wouldn't have them
    any different now, see.

    A Mongrel nation, mixed of all who fled there, who took that land for their own, you think that an insult? Have you 
    ever watched a dog fight, seen the winners? Mongrels all, The Manx have that in them, so it is, they may lack the
    heritage of the other nations, those lands being held by Drunes for so long, but by criminy when it comes to it, 
    they can show the best of us all.
