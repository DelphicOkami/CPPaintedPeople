    # Norscans

    We also call them the Wolves, I mean that's not important, but we do.

    Just like Albion there were times when if we saw them heading towards our borders it invariably spelt trouble for
    us. Over time we have gotten to know each other and begun to revel in our similarities rather than fight over our,
    differences; we're still prettier and the Morrigan would totally take Thor in a fight.


    Their tradition of shield walls, compliments our battlefield strategy of moving around a lot and killing everything
    admirably, giving us a place to find respite and healing when it is needed. Outside of battles we share a lot of
    similar traditions in the form of hospitality and song, it would be a rare time that we wouldn't welcome a Norscan
    to our table or be welcomed at theirs.
