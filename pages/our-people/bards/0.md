# Bards
 
![Bard Harp](img/bard.svg) If you need someone to tell a story, witness your deeds, or the pacts you make, then Bards are the people you need. I don't mean to say that they have no other uses but that is a good list of reasons to go looking for one.   
A good bard has a range of tales they will share with you willingly, they may not always be entirely true, but they  will be interesting.

Bard's garner a great deal of respect, and for good reason, they are the one's we send as envoys to talk to people  with the trust that they will not turn our allies into enemies, they inspire our warriors, they councel kings,  queens and other people of great import. When people visit our camp they act as hosts, this doesn't mean **just**  plying visitors with booze it also means dealing with their business or directing them to the right people *(please  note, I am rarely the right people)*

 
When a bard acts as envoy they are not to be harmed, you may not agree with or even like what they are saying but  you should not under any circumstances silence them, or worse, interrupt them mid-sentence.
 
 
## Rights
 
 
A bard should not be barred from anything happening in camp, except under extreme circumstances, so that they can  exercise their right to witness, however they are sworn to secrecy in some situations.  
 
Where a druid has the right to councel any Fir Cruthen with the voice of the Gods, a bard speaks for tradition and  law. 
 
They also have the right and obligation to warn any member of the Fir Cruthen should the bard believe that person to be on a path which will lead them to dishonour.
