# Warriors

Never sneak up on a warrior, this is the first piece of advice I would give anyone who want's to survive for 5  minutes.  
They are the head takers, the woaded, the fearless. Not just the knuckle dragging, suicidal glory seeking oafs that some may think of. Warriors carry a heavy burden, they cannot think only of themselves but of their ancestors and descendants, are they honoring their legacy and noble reputations, are they leaving their own legacy that their  descendants will be proud of. Will their deeds this day be a legend told around fires for years to come?
 
 
A Druid communes with the Gods, a Bard recites the histories and legends, a warrior ***makes*** history and through their actions can force the Gods to pay attention. A warrior stands up to mortals and Gods alike never showing  fear.  
 
There are many people who brag of being fearless, we all know those people are fools. Fear is a natural and honest response to being harmed, scorned or killed, the difference is that a Fir Cruthen warrior knows how to harness that  fear, burn it within them like fuel on a fire and unleash such a terrible hatred filled, bloody frenzy upon their  foes that even the allies of our warriors will know what fear is.
