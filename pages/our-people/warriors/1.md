I do not borrow from my Grandfather, who slew a hundred Fomori and only sheathed his blade for lack of enemies, I would not borrow the slightest of his fame, I do not lack for glory myself, for I have taken the heads of  honourable enemies and did not count them as too few to justify being given a sword, rather, I leave my deeds to  my children, my descendents, I borrow from them, for they are the ones who will uphold their heads in battle and  promise to do what I have done in this life!
