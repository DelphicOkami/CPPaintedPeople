# Caledonia
I mean, it's Caledonia, what more can I say about it. A rough, wild place comprised of the sprawling archipelagos  and island chains to the north of Albion.    
Its people are renowned for being gruff, straightforwards, and eager for a fight. Their major exports are cattle, steel, warriors, trouble, and jokes about "yer ma".

Truth be told there are few peoples I would rather have at my back in a battle than the Caledonians, whether it's  the terrifyingly powerful Tiogoradh, or the quiet, unassuming Bree. I would rather have them on my side than fight against them any day.
