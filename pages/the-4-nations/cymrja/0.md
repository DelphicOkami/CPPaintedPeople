# Cymrja

Cymrja, a land of wisdom and true beauty, more so than any of the other Fir Cruthen lands, and within Cymrja nowhere holds more of this beauty than Witch Mountain, if you ever get the chance to visit, take a Tan with you and you'll understand what true beauty looks like ... but you stay away from my ma you hear!!

To the east of Cymrja you will find the nation of Albion, these close neighbours have had a major influence on our Cymrjan brethren over the years, for in this nation you will find the Fir Cruthen's only Knightly Orders, these stand in stark contrast to the seat of the Druidic Council.
Their woad is black rather than the blue favoured by the other nations, it is the home of the Braeg Wild Elves of the Black Forest of Dyfedd, and trollish folk who inhabit the swamplands. Their leader is always referred to as The Dragon.

Cymrja has a second landmass, Gwynfydd Island, in darker times known as Cym Dubh, the Black Heart, it is entirely inhabited by Druids and those sworn to them. The Council of Druids of all four nations meet here, in seclusion, with me and from there we disperse, to spread guidance amongst the people.
Woe betide any, even the largest fleet of ships, that seek access to Gwynfydd island, they would find the going treacherous unless they have business with those who reside there.
