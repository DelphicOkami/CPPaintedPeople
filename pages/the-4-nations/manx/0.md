# Manx

Let's look at this map, you see those 3 green blobs over to the left, those are Bronagh, Mann, and Keirlug they are  Manx, yes all of them.  
You see, Manx is a mongrel nation settled from the other three nations because of this they carry a part of the  other nations within them. The people of Manx excel at near enough everything they set their minds to, hell they  have the second most complete library in all of our lands, that is kept in Kierluig.  

Really the only thing stopping Manx from dominating the world is the fact that everyone and their third cousin seems to invade every other week, I think they're all just looking for Manxvegas but we will see when we actually take  back control of the islands.
