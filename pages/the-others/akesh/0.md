# The Akesh

They came from the lands even further west than our own fair isles, I don't fully trust them and I would encourage you to show them suspicion too. I do not recommend this idly, they work with demons, this alone should be reason to not trust them.

They have told me that the group that is on our continent, (the Eastern continent as they call it), is out of favour with their home nation, and are seeking to throw off the yolks of their rulers, **WHO ARE DEMONS!!**

Whilst I do not trust them, we do have a relationship with them and if they can prove that they aren't demon worshiping scum, I might suggest that we don't kill them all.
