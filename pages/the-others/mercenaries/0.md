# Mercenaries
The landless people, sell swords, they carry very little political sway in the world around them. We try to be honest in our dealings with them and expect the same from them. We often make great use of them for battles, when we do this we treat them as our own people, they are invited to attend our pre-battle rites, can receive the blessings of woad, and should be looked after on the battle field and not squandered as arrow fodder.
