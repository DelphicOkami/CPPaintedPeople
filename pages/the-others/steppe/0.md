# The Steppe Alliance  

For a long time we scorned them, they are weak and their disparate natures make them difficult to understand, but they are slowly starting to build their prestige in the world and their people are becoming less isolated.  
I view them as a potential close ally especially if they become a strong voice in the world it could be useful to have them on our side.
