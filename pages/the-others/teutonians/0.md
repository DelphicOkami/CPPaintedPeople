Misguided, arrogant, bureaucratic idiots, they use the undead to work their lands and labour on their civic works. They may not all be terrible people but they benefit from a system that relies on the undead and it is difficult for myself and a lot of others to see past that.  

I do not believe that our two nations will ever be close allies, our core values are in too much conflict, their bureaucracy vs our simple laws, their reliance on the undead vs our abhorrence of such practices, but I can respect them. They have been through a lot of internal struggles and come out stronger because of them, they are organised to a fault and have always been fair in their dealings with us, even when we didn't like the outcomes we know that their own people would have been treated the same.
