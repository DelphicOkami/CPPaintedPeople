# Taniaste
![Bryn's Portrait](img/bryn.svg)
The single most, attractive, intelligent, and above all modest person you will ever meet. I am the Taniaste, I carry the memories of countless lifetimes, I use these memories to advise both the Ymherawdwr and Winter Prince, but more importantly I act as an advisor to anyone who asks for it.

I remember the people from the time before we were the Fir Cruthen, before you even knew who you were, I will stay with you for as long as you need me to. I have no doubt that there will come a day when you no-longer have need of me and I will finally be able to rest.
