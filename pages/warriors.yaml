    Never sneak up on a warrior, this is the first piece of advice I would give anyone who want's to survive for 5 
    minutes.  
    
    They are the head takers, the woaded, the fearless. Not just the knuckle dragging, suicidal glory seeking oafs that some
    may think of. Warriors carry a heavy burden, they cannot think only of themselves but of their ancestors and
    descendants, are they honoring their legacy and noble reputations, are they leaving their own legacy that their 
    descendants will be proud of. Will their deeds this day be a legend told around fires for years to come?
     
     
    A Druid communes with the Gods, a Bard recites the histories and legends, a warrior ***makes*** history and through
    their actions can force the Gods to pay attention. A warrior stands up to mortals and Gods alike never showing 
    fear.  
     
    There are many people who brag of being fearless, we all know those people are fools. Fear is a natural and honest
    response to being harmed, scorned or killed, the difference is that a Fir Cruthen warrior knows how to harness that 
    fear, burn it within them like fuel on a fire and unleash such a terrible hatred filled, bloody frenzy upon their 
    foes that even the allies of our warriors will know what fear is.

    I do not borrow from my Grandfather, who slew a hundred Fomori and only sheathed his blade for lack of enemies,
    I would not borrow the slightest of his fame, I do not lack for glory myself, for I have taken the heads of 
    honourable enemies and did not count them as too few to justify being given a sword, rather, I leave my deeds to 
    my children, my descendents, I borrow from them, for they are the ones who will uphold their heads in battle and 
    promise to do what I have done in this life!
