    Why, we are the sons and daughters the Gods have most favoured, we have no scales over our eyes, we know life, and
    love it, and we know death, and do not fear it. We know hardship, yet are not broken by it, we know treachery, but
    do not stoop to it, we know excess, but do not succumb to it, and we know glory, yet do not unduly claim it.


    Our Gods both comfort and contain us, for without their guidance and harsh lessons, the world by now would be
    overrun by the sheer indomitable spirit of our people, not for we wish to rule the world, faugh!, that is a poor
    ambition! Why seek to rule a world you already own? To rule a world you already stride upon with the surety that
    there is no living one on this earth as sure of yourself as you, that you are of the blood of heroes, are a hero,
    and will be begotten by heroes?


    What mortal crown could ever hold such lustre as the shine of pride in a kinsmans eyes at your deeds, and the shine
    of tears at your wake.


    We know who we are, and our Gods know who we are, and they love us for it, for we are their sons and daughters most
    favoured.


    We are Fir Cruthen.

    The Fir Cruthen are the inhabitants of what were previously thought to be the westernmost lands of the world, of
    Caledonia, Cymrja, Manx and Erin. Many see them as savages, bloodthirsty on the battlefield, and soporific with ale
    when at rest. Whilst there is a kernel of truth to these observations, they do not, as ever, paint the full picture.


    The Fir Cruthen are an ancient people, that much is certain, at least from their own legends, their tales tell of
    heroes who walked the earth alongside Gods, of creatures they wrested their lands from, creatures of immeasurable
    power, that to this day plot their revenge, The Fir Cruthen people’s heritage is one of blood shed but it is not
    simply enemy blood, or the blood of "heroes".


    It is often said that scratch a Celt, and the blood that wells from them is the same as that of kings, champions and
    rulers of other nations, whether a King, Warchief, Battlesmiter, Crofter, or Fisherman, every Fir Cruthen can take
    pride in what they are, and all are honoured by their people. It is notable that whilst the Fir Cruthen have a
    hierarchy, and what seems at first to be a feudal society, in fact it is anything but, the higher in rank one is,
    the more responsibilities one has to ones people. The Fir Cruthen have no ‘peasants’, no ‘serfs’ and no ‘slaves’.

    The closest they have is the folk, and that is a catch all word to mean all those whom they have obligation to,
    and in the Fir Cruthen, that obligation always runs downhill, a member of the folk will show loyalty to their Chief,
    but that Chief must ensure the prosperity of the folk under their care, their safety, and their trust.

    There we stood, rank upon rank of us, and we could hear them; their ungodly howls, shapes flitting in the mist only
    adding to our horror, and then silence, a dread silence. The silence stretched, til men grinned, and nudged their
    neighbours.


    "Not so bad eh, savages gone home" ... Beaufeld said that, just before the spear tip took him in his throat.


    Then they came. Dread, a shrieking howling charge, flesh painted in horrific swirls and spirals to dizzy the eye,
    covered in blood and strewn with trophies, severed heads, ears and limbs. Their blades raised high in exultation, or
    thrust forth in eagerness to add to the bloodshed of the day, thousands of tongues giving voice to a bestial cry of
    barbarism, a dreadful horde that nonetheless almost flew across the glen in their desire for battle, and endless
    wave of barbarous warriors piling into or right flank, hewing and carving and when we thought all was lost and
    naught could be worse, a powerful war horn blew, we could feel it in the earth beneath our feet, and then upon our
    left flank fell another wave, just as terrible, this time, their men folk....
