Why, we are the sons and daughters the Gods have most favoured, we have no scales over our eyes, we know life, and love it, and we know death, and do not fear it. We know hardship, yet are not broken by it, we know treachery, but do not stoop to it, we know excess, but do not succumb to it, and we know glory, yet do not unduly claim it.

Our Gods both comfort and contain us, for without their guidance and harsh lessons, the world by now would be overrun by the sheer indomitable spirit of our people, not for we wish to rule the world, faugh!, that is a poor ambition! Why seek to rule a world you already own? To rule a world you already stride upon with the surety that there is no living one on this earth as sure of yourself as you, that you are of the blood of heroes, are a hero, and will be begotten by heroes?

What mortal crown could ever hold such lustre as the shine of pride in a kinsmans eyes at your deeds, and the shine of tears at your wake.

We know who we are, and our Gods know who we are, and they love us for it, for we are their sons and daughters most favoured.

We are Fir Cruthen.
